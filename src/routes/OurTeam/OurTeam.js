                Hisham is an academic head and neck cancer surgeon with a keen interest in clinical and translational research, 
                heading a research team of 15 researchers, and holding over £15 million in research grants. His research has changed 
                clinical practice globally in the field of head and neck cancer. His experience of multi-disciplinary research in the 
                field of cancer biology and treatment has made him a strong proponent of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research, 
                as the way to provide new insights and approaches to address intractable global challenges.

                Hisham is the Deputy Pro-Vice Chancellor responsible for inter-disciplinary research across the University. 
                He is also Director of Institute for Global Innovation (the IGI) and Institute for Advanced Studies, where he strives to 
                ensure that the Institute inspires supports and delivers world-leading, multi- and inter-disciplinary research that seeks 
                to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, which affect humanity at a global level. 

                The IGI’s research themes revolve around the factors that challenge, and sometimes threaten, the sustainability and 
                resilience of individuals, communities, countries and the world as a whole. Our themes include resilient cities, water 
                challenges in a changing world, clean cooling, pollution solutions, antimicrobial resistance, ageing and frailty, gender 
                inequality, artificial intelligence and 21st century transnational crime. Our scholars seek, to not only understand these 
                problems, but also develop and implement innovative and often disruptive solutions, made possible by their holistic, 
                inter-disciplinary approaches.

              <p>
              Dina Kiwan is a Professor in Comparative Education, having joined the department in January 2017. 
              Her research programme focuses on citizenship and inclusion, and is interdisciplinary and comparative 
              in scope. Her interests centre around sociological and politico-philosophical examinations of inclusive 
              citizenship through the lens of education policy, naturalization policy and migration policy, in 
              particular in the context of pluralist / multicultural societies, and also societies in conflict.  
              Her work engages with the inter-relationships between theory, research, policy and practice. 
              Her interests in critical policy analysis are complemented by an interest in how those deemed to 
              be ‘marginalised’ and vulnerable’ constitute themselves as political actors. Publications include Kiwan (2008). 
              Education for Inclusive Citizenship (Routledge), and Kiwan, D. (ed). (2013) Naturalization Policies, Education 
              and Citizenship: Multicultural and Multination Societies in International Perspective (Palgrave Macmillan).
